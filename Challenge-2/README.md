### Energy Storage Landing Page Animation (80 points)

This is the ultimate challenge for a designer. The video provided for this shows a web page with eye-catching motion design made by an
experienced designer.

You may choose to skip the animation part and design just the static
site, which will give you a maximum of 30 points.

Designing the whole page with the motion design can get you 80 points!

Note: You may need to make your own Images/SVGs if they’re not
available on the internet. If need be, you can use similar-looking images/SVGs.

We have provided a few links for you to get started with
animations in Figma and Adobe XD.
